They're not \"shopping around.\" They picked YOU.\n\nBut here's the psychology:\n\nRing 1-2: They're patient.\nRing 3-4: They're annoyed.\nRing 5+: They assume you're closed, disorganized, or don't care.\n\nStudies show 85% of people who hang up don't call back. They call the next name on Google.\n\nThat's not a missed call. That's a patient choosing your competitor because you were 10 seconds too slow.\n\nThe practice that answers fastest wins. Not the best dentist. Not the cheapest. The fastest.\n\nSomething to think about next time your front desk is \"busy.\"\n\nVisuals:\n• Phone ringing with ring count overlay\n• Patient facial expression shifting (patient → annoyed → gone)\n• Google search: \"dentist near me\" with competitor clicking\n• No CTA — just value"

Holds again. By minute 3, they've hung up and called your competitor.\n\nMistake 2: The voicemail black hole.\n\"Leave a message and we'll call you back.\" 70% of patients don't leave one. They just call the next name on Google.\n\nMistake 3: The information dump.\nPatient asks one question. Receptionist gives a 2-minute speech about insurance, hours, parking, and paperwork. Patient just wanted to know if you're taking new patients.\n\nEvery one of these costs you $200+ per call.\n\nThe fix isn't hiring more people. It's designing a system where patients get answers in under 10 seconds.\n\nFollow for more — I post stuff like this every week.\n\nVisuals:\n• You talking direct to camera\n• Text overlays for each mistake\n• Timer showing hold time climbing\n• Quick cuts between each point"
