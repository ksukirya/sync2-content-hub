They're not \"shopping around.\" They picked YOU.\n\nBut here's the psychology:\n\nRing 1-2: They're patient.\nRing 3-4: They're annoyed.\nRing 5+: They assume you're closed, disorganized, or don't care.\n\nStudies show 85% of people who hang up don't call back. They call the next name on Google.\n\nThat's not a missed call. That's a patient choosing your competitor because you were 10 seconds too slow.\n\nThe practice that answers fastest wins. Not the best dentist. Not the cheapest. The fastest.\n\nSomething to think about next time your front desk is \"busy.\""

Zero went to voicemail.\n\nWeek two: They noticed something weird. Appointments were booking at 11pm. At 2am. At 6am on Sunday.\n\nTurns out 40% of their ideal clients — busy professionals — can only call outside business hours.\n\nMonth one results:\n- 94% booking rate\n- $11,400 in recovered revenue\n- Staff focusing on patients, not phones\n\nThe owner told me: \"This is like having a receptionist that never sleeps, never calls in sick, and never puts anyone on hold.\"\n\nComment 'DEMO' if you want to see how it works for your practice."

Holds again. By minute 3, they've hung up and called your competitor.\n\nMistake 2: The voicemail black hole.\n\"Leave a message and we'll call you back.\" 70% of patients don't leave one. They just call the next name on Google.\n\nMistake 3: The information dump.\nPatient asks one question. Receptionist gives a 2-minute speech about insurance, hours, parking, and paperwork. Patient just wanted to know if you're taking new patients.\n\nEvery one of these costs you $200+ per call.\n\nThe fix isn't hiring more people. It's designing a system where patients get answers in under 10 seconds.\n\nFollow for more — I post stuff like this every week."
