## Script 11: The Competitor Steal
**Type:** VALUE  
**Length:** 65s  
**Hook:** "Your competitor answered 47 calls you missed last month. Here's how I know."

### Script:
I just ran an audit for a dental practice. They were confused why new patient numbers were down.

So I looked at their data.

312 calls last month. 47 went to voicemail.

Then I searched "dentist near me" from their zip code. The first competitor has 24/7 phone coverage. Answers in 2 rings.

I called them. They picked up in 4 seconds.

I called my client. Ring... ring... ring... voicemail.

Those 47 missed calls? They didn't disappear. They went to the guy who answers.

Average patient value: $5,000 lifetime.

47 × $5,000 = $235,000 in potential revenue. Gone.

Your competitors aren't stealing patients with better marketing. They're stealing them by picking up the phone.

## Script 12: The Burnout Loop
**Type:** VALUE  
**Length:** 70s  
**Hook:** "Here's the cycle that burns out every front desk employee in 18 months."

### Script:
Practice owners ask me why they can't keep front desk staff.

Here's the pattern I see in every burned-out practice:

Month 1-3: New hire is excited. Learning fast.

Month 4-6: Phone volume increases. No backup added. They're handling 5 things at once.

Month 7-12: Mistakes start. Missed calls. Messed up appointments. They feel like failures but they're just overwhelmed.

Month 13-18: They quit. You start over.

The problem isn't the people. It's the system.

One person cannot answer phones, greet patients, handle insurance, AND manage scheduling. Especially during lunch rush.

The practices that keep staff for 5+ years do one thing differently: They give their team backup.

AI for overflow calls. Systems for repetitive tasks. Humans for what humans do best.

Stop cycling through receptionists. Start building systems.

- Overwhelmed receptionist visual
- "Staff turnover" statistic
- Solution: AI + Human working together

## Script 13: The Review Hack
**Type:** VALUE  
**Length:** 60s  
**Hook:** "How one practice went from 3.8 to 4.7 stars in 90 days. No fake reviews."

### Script:
This practice had 47 Google reviews averaging 3.8 stars. They were invisible in local search.

90 days later: 183 reviews averaging 4.7 stars.

Here's exactly what they did.

Every patient who books gets a confirmation text. Normal.

But after their visit, they get ONE more text: "How was your experience today?"

If they respond positively, the system automatically sends: "Would you mind sharing that on Google? Here's the link."

That's it. Two texts. Automated. No asking patients in person which feels awkward.

47% of happy patients left reviews.

Their Google ranking jumped from page 2 to position 3 in the map pack.

New patient calls increased 34%.

The hack isn't magic. It's asking happy patients to share. Automatically. At the right moment.

### Visuals:
- Before: 3.8 stars, 47 reviews
- After: 4.7 stars, 183 reviews
- Text message sequence on phone
- Google Maps showing position improvement
- Graph of new patient calls trending up

## Script 14: The $40/Hour Mistake
**Type:** VALUE  
**Length:** 65s  
**Hook:** "Your $40/hour receptionist is doing $12/hour tasks. That's a $50K/year mistake."

### Script:
Let's do uncomfortable math.

Your receptionist costs $35-45K plus benefits. Call it $50K loaded.

What are they actually doing?

40% answering "What are your hours?" and "Do you take my insurance?"
25% appointment reminders and confirmations
20% rescheduling and basic booking
15% actual patient care and complex tasks

That's 85% of their time on tasks a $500/month system could handle.

You're paying a human to do robot work. And burning them out in the process.

The fix isn't replacing them. It's freeing them.

Automate the repetitive. Let your team handle the human stuff — nervous patients, insurance questions, the relationship building that makes people stay for 10 years.

Your $50K employee should be doing $50K work. Not answering what time you close.

- Employee looking exhausted vs engaged

## Script 15: The Silent Killer
**Type:** PITCH  
**Length:** 70s  
**Hook:** "There's a number in your practice you've never seen. It's costing you $8K/month."

### Script:
I call it the silent killer. And it exists in every practice.

It's your after-hours booking rate.

The number of patients who call when you're closed... and never call back.

Most practices have no idea what this number is. Because voicemails don't track hang-ups.

So we installed tracking on 23 practices last quarter. The average?

34 after-hours calls per week. 78% never leave a voicemail. They just call your competitor instead.

34 × 78% = 27 lost patients per week.
27 × $300 average first visit = $8,100/week.
That's $32K/month. Gone. Silently.

You can't fix what you can't see.

Comment 'TRACK' and I'll show you how to measure this number in your practice for free.

### Visuals:
- Mystery number visual with question marks
- Phone showing "after hours" message
- 78% statistic appearing dramatically
- Calculator: 27 × $300 = $8,100/week
- "Comment TRACK" CTA

## Script 16: The Language Gap
**Type:** VALUE  
**Length:** 60s  
**Hook:** "23% of your missed revenue speaks Spanish. Most practices ignore them."

### Script:
Depending on your location, 15-30% of potential patients prefer to speak Spanish.

What happens when they call most practices?

"Press 1 for English." They press 2. Voicemail. Or worse — nothing.

They hang up. They find a practice with bilingual staff.

Here's what smart practices do:

AI that detects language in real-time. Patient starts speaking Spanish? Seamless switch. No menus. No "please hold for a translator."

Just instant service in their language.

One practice in Phoenix added Spanish AI coverage. New Spanish-speaking patients increased 340% in 3 months.

$47,000 in additional revenue.

Your competitors are ignoring 23% of the market. That's your opportunity.

### Visuals:
- Map showing Spanish-speaking populations
- Phone menu screen with language options
- AI switching languages mid-conversation
- Graph: 340% increase in patients
- Revenue number: $47K

## Script 17: The 9-Second Rule
**Type:** VALUE  
**Length:** 65s  
**Hook:** "You have 9 seconds. That's how long a new patient decides if they trust you."

### Script:
Stanford research: people form trust impressions in 9 seconds.

On a phone call, it's even faster.

Second 1-3: Did someone answer? Or am I hitting buttons?
Second 4-6: Do they sound competent? Or flustered?
Second 7-9: Do I feel heard? Or like caller #47?

Miss any of these, and they're mentally shopping competitors before you even offer an appointment.

The best front desk scripts nail all three:

"Good morning, [Practice Name], this is Sarah, how can I help you today?"

Answered quickly. Sounds professional. Invites them to share.

Seems obvious. But call 10 practices and see how many actually do this.

The 9 seconds after they call determines if they stay for 9 years.

### Visuals:
- Countdown timer 9→0
- Three trust checkpoints appearing
- Good script example on screen
- Call 10 competitors challenge
- 9 seconds → 9 years graphic

## Script 18: The Monday Problem
**Type:** PITCH  
**Length:** 75s  
**Hook:** "Monday between 8-10am. That's when 40% of your weekly calls happen."

### Script:
We analyzed 2.3 million practice calls.

The busiest window? Monday, 8-10am.

Why? People spend the weekend ignoring that tooth pain. Monday morning they finally call.

Problem: That's also when your staff is catching up on weekend emails, voicemails, and emergencies.

The result? Monday morning has 3x the missed call rate of any other time.

You're losing your best leads when your team is most overwhelmed.

Here's the fix:

Don't try to staff up just for Monday morning. That's expensive and inefficient.

Use AI backup specifically for peak overflow. Monday 8-10am. Lunch hour. Friday afternoon.

Keep your team focused on care. Let systems handle the surge.

Comment 'MONDAY' for our peak hour playbook.

## Script 19: The Trust Test
**Type:** INTERACTIVE  
**Length:** 70s  
**Hook:** "Can you tell which practice is real and which is AI? Most people can't."

### Script:
I'm going to play two greeting recordings. Both are dental practices.

One is a real human receptionist.
One is AI.

[Play Greeting A - 8 seconds]

[Play Greeting B - 8 seconds]

Comment A or B — which one is human?

...

I'll tell you the answer in my next video.

But here's the point: If you had to guess, so do your patients.

They don't care if it's AI or human. They care about three things:
1. Did someone answer?
2. Did they solve my problem?
3. Was it fast and painless?

The practices winning in 2024 aren't debating AI vs human. They're using both — strategically.

Follow for the answer.

### Visuals:
- Two audio waveforms side by side
- "A" and "B" labels
- "Comment your guess" CTA
- Patient perspective: "Did they answer? Did they help? Was it fast?"
- Cliffhanger: "Answer tomorrow"

## Script 20: The 5-Year Patient
**Type:** PITCH  
**Length:** 75s  
**Hook:** "I tracked one patient for 5 years. Here's what she was worth."

### Script:
Let me tell you about Maria.

She called a dental practice at 7pm on a Tuesday. Most practices were closed.

This one had AI answering after hours. She booked a cleaning for Saturday.

Here's what happened over 5 years:

Year 1: Cleaning, X-rays, one filling. $580.
Year 2: Two cleanings, crown consultation. $640.
Year 3: Crown, two cleanings, brought her husband. $1,850.
Year 4: Implant consult, cleanings, whitening. $2,200.
Year 5: Implant, cleanings, referred her sister. $4,100.

Total: $9,370.

Plus her husband: $3,200.
Plus her sister: $2,100.

One 7pm phone call. $14,670 in revenue.

If that call had gone to voicemail? Zero.

Every after-hours call is a potential Maria. Are you answering?
